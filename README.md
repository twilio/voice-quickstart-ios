### <a name="bullet1"></a>1. Install the TwilioVoice framework

**Carthage**

Add the following line to your Cartfile

```
github "twilio/twilio-voice-ios"
```

Then run `carthage bootstrap` (or `carthage update` if you are updating your SDKs)

On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: `/bin/sh`), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

```
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```

Add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”, e.g.:

```
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/TwilioVoice.framework
```

**Cocoapods**

Under the quickstart path, run `pod install` and let the Cocoapods library create the workspace for you. Also please make sure to use **Cocoapods v1.0 and later**.
Once Cocoapods finishes installing, open the `SwiftVoiceQuickstart.xcworkspace` and you will find a basic Swift quickstart project and a CallKit quickstart project.

Note: You may need to update the [CocoaPods Master Spec Repo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs) by running `pod repo update master` in order to fetch the latest specs for TwilioVoice.

### <a name="bullet2"></a>2. Create a Voice API key
Go to the [Voice API Keys](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/settings/api-keys) page and create a new API key:

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/create-api-key.png"/></kbd>

**Save the generated `API_KEY` and `API_KEY_SECRET` in your notepad**. You will need them in the next step.

### <a name="bullet3"></a>3. Configure a server to generate an access token to be used in the app

Download one of the starter projects for the server.

* [voice-quickstart-server-java](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-server-java)
* [voice-quickstart-server-node](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-server-node)
* [voice-quickstart-server-php](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-server-php)
* [voice-quickstart-server-python](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-server-python)

Follow the instructions in the server's README to get the application server up and running locally and accessible via the public Internet. For now just replace the **Twilio Account SID** that you can obtain from the [console](https://www.twilio.com/console), and the `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` you obtained in the previous step.
    
    ACCOUNT_SID = 'AC***'
    API_KEY = 'SK***'
    API_KEY_SECRET = '***'

### <a name="bullet4"></a>4. Create a TwiML application
Next, we need to create a TwiML application. A TwiML application identifies a public URL for retrieving [TwiML call control instructions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml). When your iOS app makes a call to the Twilio cloud, Twilio will make a webhook request to this URL, your application server will respond with generated TwiML, and Twilio will execute the instructions you’ve provided.
To create a TwiML application, go to the [TwiML app page](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/dev-tools/twiml-apps). Create a new TwiML application, and use the public URL of your application server’s `/makeCall` endpoint as the Voice Request URL (If your app server is written in PHP, then you need `.php` extension at the end).

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/create-twiml-app.png"/></kbd>

As you can see we’ve used our [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) public address in the Request URL field above.
Save your TwiML Application configuration, and grab the **TwiML Application SID** (a long identifier beginning with the characters `AP`).

### <a name="bullet5"></a>5. Configure your application server
Let's put the remaining `APP_SID` configuration info into your server code. 

    ACCOUNT_SID = 'AC***'
    API_KEY = 'SK***'
    API_KEY_SECRET = '***'
    APP_SID = 'AP***'

Once you’ve done that, restart the server so it uses the new configuration info. Now it's time to test.

Open up a browser and visit the URL for your application server's **Access Token endpoint**: `https://{YOUR_SERVER_URL}/accessToken` (If your app server is written in PHP, then you need `.php` extension at the end). If everything is configured correctly, you should see a long string of letters and numbers, which is a Twilio Access Token. Your iOS app will use a token like this to connect to Twilio.

### <a name="bullet6"></a>6. Run the app
Now let’s go back to the `SwiftVoiceQuickstart.xcworkspace`. Update the placeholder of `baseURLString` with your ngrok public URL

```swift
import UIKit
import AVFoundation
import PushKit
import TwilioVoice

let baseURLString = "https://3b57e324.ngrok.io"
let accessTokenEndpoint = "/accessToken"
let identity = "alice"
let twimlParamTo = "to"

class ViewController: UIViewController, PKPushRegistryDelegate, TVONotificationDelegate, TVOCallDelegate, AVAudioPlayerDelegate, UITextFieldDelegate {
```

Build and run the app

<kbd><img width="500px" src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/build-and-run.png"/></kbd>

Leave the text field empty and press the call button to start a call. You will hear the congratulatory message. Support for dialing another client or number is described in steps 11 and 12. Tap "Hang Up" to disconnect.

<kbd><img width="500px" src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/hang-up.png"/></kbd>

### <a name="bullet7"></a>7. Create VoIP Service Certificate
The Programmable Voice SDK uses Apple’s VoIP Services to let your application know when it is receiving an incoming call. If you want your users to receive incoming calls, you’ll need to enable VoIP Services in your application and generate a VoIP Services Certificate.

Go to [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/) and you’ll need to do the following:
- An Apple Developer membership to be able to create the certificate.
- Make sure your App ID has the “Push Notifications” service enabled.
- Create a corresponding Provisioning Profile for your app ID.
- Create an [Apple VoIP Services Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/OptimizeVoIP.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015243-CH30-SW1) for this app by navigating to Certificates --> Production and clicking the `+` on the top right to add the new certificate.

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/create-voip-service-certificate.png"/></kbd>

### <a name="bullet8"></a>8. Create a Push Credential with your VoIP Service Certificate
Once you have generated the VoIP Services Certificate using Keychain Access, you will need to upload it to Twilio so that Twilio can send push notifications to your app on your behalf.

Export your VoIP Service Certificate as a .p12 file from Keychain Access, then extract the certificate and private key from the .p12 file using the `openssl` command. If .p12 is not an option for exporting, type `voip` into the search bar of Keychain Access and make sure you select both items when exporting the certificate.

    $> openssl pkcs12 -in PATH_TO_YOUR_P12 -nocerts -out key.pem
    $> openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pem
    $> openssl pkcs12 -in PATH_TO_YOUR_P12 -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.pem

Go to the [Push Credentials page](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/sdks/credentials) and create a new Push Credential. Paste the certificate and private key extracted from your certificate. You must paste the keys in as plaintext:

* For the `cert.pem` you should paste everything from `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` to `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. 
* For the `key.pem` you should paste everything from `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

**Remember to check the “Sandbox” option**. This is important. The VoIP Service Certificate you generated can be used both in production and with Apple's sandbox infrastructure. Checking this box tells Twilio to send your pushes to the Apple sandbox infrastructure which is appropriate with your development provisioning profile.

Once the app is ready for store submission, update the plist with “APS Environment: production” and create another Push Credential with the same VoIP Certificate but without checking the sandbox option.

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/add-push-credential.png"/></kbd>

Now let's go back to your server code and update the Push Credential SID. The Push Credential SID will now be embedded in your access token.

    PUSH_CREDENTIAL_SID = 'CR***'

### <a name="bullet9"></a>9. Configure Xcode project settings for push notifications
On the project’s Capabilities tab, enable “**Push Notifications**”.
In Xcode 8 or earlier, enable both “**Voice over IP**” and “**Audio, AirPlay and Picture in Picture**” capabilities in the Background Modes

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/xcode-project-capabilities.png"/></kbd>

In Xcode 9+, make sure that the “**Audio, AirPlay and Picture in Picture**” capability is enabled and a "**UIBackgroundModes**" dictionary with "**audio**" and "**voip**" is in the app's plist.
```
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>audio</string>
  <string>voip</string>
</array>
```

### <a name="bullet10"></a>10. Receive an incoming call
You are now ready to receive incoming calls. Rebuild your app and hit your application server's **/placeCall** endpoint: `https://{YOUR_SERVER_URL}/placeCall` (If your app server is written in PHP, then you need `.php` extension at the end). This will trigger a Twilio REST API request that will make an inbound call to your mobile app. Once your app accepts the call, you should hear a congratulatory message.

<kbd><img width="500px" src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/incoming-call.png"/></kbd>

### <a name="bullet11"></a>11. Make client to client call
To make client to client calls, you need the application running on two devices. To run the application on an additional device, make sure you use a different identity in your access token when registering the new device. For example, change `kIdentity` to `bob` and run the application

```swift
let accessTokenEndpoint = "/accessToken"
let identity = "bob"
let twimlParamTo = "to"
```

Use the text field to specify the identity of the call receiver, then tap the “Call” button to make a call. The TwiML parameters used in `TwilioVoice.call()` method should match the name used in the server.

<kbd><img width="500px" src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/client-to-client.png"/></kbd>

### <a name="bullet12"></a>12. Make client to PSTN call
A verified phone number is one that you can use as your Caller ID when making outbound calls with Twilio. This number has not been ported into Twilio and you do not pay Twilio for this phone number.

To make client to number calls, first get a valid Twilio number to your account via https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified. Update your server code and replace `CALLER_NUMBER` with the verified number. Restart the server so it uses the new value. Voice Request URL of your TwiML application should point to the public URL of your application server’s `/makeCall` endpoint.

<kbd><img width="500px" src="https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift/raw/master/Images/client-to-pstn.png"/></kbd>

## Access Tokens

The access token generated by your server component is a [jwt](https://jwt.io) that contains a `grant` for Programmable Voice, an `identity` that you specify, and a `time-to-live` that sets the lifetime of the generated access token. The default `time-to-live` is 1 hour and is configurable up to 24 hours using the Twilio helper libraries.

### Uses

In the iOS SDK the access token is used for the following:

1. To make an outgoing call via `TwilioVoice.call(...)`
2. To register or unregister for incoming notifications using VoIP Push Notifications via `TwilioVoice.registerWithAccessToken(...)` and `TwilioVoice.unregisterWithAccessToken(...)`. Once registered, incoming notifications are handled via a `TVOCallInvite` where you can choose to accept or reject the invite. When accepting the call an access token is not required. Internally the `TVOCallInvite` has its own access token that ensures it can connect to our infrastructure.

### Managing Expiry

As mentioned above, an access token will eventually expire. If an access token has expired, our infrastructure will return error `TVOErrorAccessTokenExpired`/`20104` via `TVOCallDelegate` or a completion error when registering.

There are number of techniques you can use to ensure that access token expiry is managed accordingly:

- Always fetch a new access token from your access token server before making an outbound call.
- Retain the access token until getting a `TVOErrorAccessTokenExpired`/`20104` error before fetching a new access token.
- Retain the access token along with the timestamp of when it was requested so you can verify ahead of time whether the token has already expired based on the `time-to-live` being used by your server.
- Prefetch the access token whenever the `UIApplication`, or `UIViewController` associated with an outgoing call is created.

## Managing Audio Interruptions
Different versions of iOS deal with **AVAudioSession** interruptions sightly differently. This section documents how the Programmable Voice iOS SDK manages audio interruptions and resumes call audio after the interruption ends. There are currently some cases that the SDK cannot resume call audio automatically because iOS does not provide the necessary notifications to indicate that the interruption has ended.

### How Programmable Voice iOS SDK handles audio interruption
- The SDK registers itself as an observer of `AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification` in `TwilioVoice.initialize()`.
- When the notification is fired and the interruption type is `AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeBegan`, the SDK automatically disables the audio device and puts any active Calls on hold.
- When the SDK receives the notification with `AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeEnded`, it re-enables the audio device and resumes the audio of active Calls.
  - We have noticed that on iOS 8 and 9, the interruption notification with `AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeEnded` is not always fired therefore the SDK is not able to resume call audio automatically. This is a known issue and an alternative way is to use the `UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification` and resume audio when the app is active again after the interruption.

### Notifications in different iOS versions
Below is a table listing the system notifications received with different steps to trigger audio interruptions and resume during an active Voice SDK call. (Assume the app is in an active Voice SDK call)

|Scenario|Notification of interruption-begins|Notification of interruption-ends|Call audio resumes?|Note|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|PSTN Interruption|
|A.<br>PSTN interruption<br>Accept the PSTN incoming call<br>Remote party of PSTN call hangs up|:white_check_mark: iOS 9<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 10<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 11|:white_check_mark: iOS 9<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 10<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 11|:white_check_mark: iOS 9<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 10<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 11| |

### CallKit
On iOS 10 and later, CallKit (if integrated) takes care of the interruption by providing a set of delegate methods so that the application can respond with proper audio device handling and state transitioning in order to ensure call audio works after the interruption has ended.

#### Notifications & Callbacks during Interruption
By enabling the `supportsHolding` flag of the `CXCallUpdate` object when reporting a call to the CallKit framework, you will see the **“Hold & Accept”** option when there is another PSTN or CallKit-enabled call. By pressing the **“Hold & Accept”** option, a series of things and callbacks will happen:

1. The `provider:performSetHeldCallAction:` delegate method is called with `CXSetHeldCallAction.isOnHold = YES`. Put the Voice call on-hold here and fulfill the action.
2. The `AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification` notification is fired to indicate the AVAudioSession interruption has started.
3. CallKit will deactivate the AVAudioSession of your app and fire the `provider:didDeactivateAudioSession:` callback. You need to disable the SDK audio device by calling `TwilioVoice.audioEnabled = NO`.
4. When the interrupting call ends, instead of getting the `AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification` notification, the system will notify that you can resume the call audio that was put on-hold when the interruption began by calling the `provider:performSetHeldCallAction:` method again. **Note** that this callback is not fired if the interrupting call is disconnected by the remote party.
5. The AVAudioSession of the app will be activated again and you should re-enable the audio device of the SDK `TwilioVoice.audioEnabled = YES` in the `provider:didActivateAudioSession:` method.

|Scenario|Audio resumes after interrupion?|Note|
|---|---|---|
|A.<br>Hold & Accept<br>Hang up PSTN interruption on the local end|:white_check_mark: iOS 10<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 11| |
|B.<br>Hold & Accept<br>Remote party hangs up PSTN interruption|:x: iOS 10<br>:x: iOS 11|`provider:performSetHeldCallAction:` not called after the interruption ends.|
|C.<br>Hold & Accept<br>Switch back to the Voice Call on system UI|:white_check_mark: iOS 10<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 11| |
|D.<br>Reject|:white_check_mark: iOS 10<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 11|No actual audio interruption happened since the interrupting call is not answered|
|E.<br>Ignore|:white_check_mark: iOS 10<br>:white_check_mark: iOS 11|No actual audio interruption happened since the interrupting call is not answered|

In case 2, CallKit does not automatically resume call audio by calling `provider:performSetHeldCallAction:` method, but the system UI will show that the Voice call is still on-hold. You can resume the call using the **"Hold"** button, or use the `CXSetHeldCallAction` to lift the on-hold state programmatically. The app is also responsible of updating UI state to indicate the "hold" state of the call to avoid user confusion.

```.objc
// Resume call audio programmatically after interruption
CXSetHeldCallAction *setHeldCallAction = [[CXSetHeldCallAction alloc] initWithCallUUID:self.call.uuid onHold:holdSwitch.on];
CXTransaction *transaction = [[CXTransaction alloc] initWithAction:setHeldCallAction];
[self.callKitCallController requestTransaction:transaction completion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"Failed to submit set-call-held transaction request");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Set-call-held transaction successfully done");
    }
}];
```
